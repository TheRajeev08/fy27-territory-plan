"""FY27 H1 leadership deck - the 30-minute executive cut.

Eleven slides: the seven questions leadership asked, plus a carry-forward slide and a
live-deals slide, and nothing else. The long deck (deck.py) remains the evidence pack;
this is what gets presented. Theme and layout
primitives are imported from deck.py so both decks stay visually identical and only one
of them owns rendering behaviour.

    exec_deck.py <runDir> <out.pptx>

Reads focus-accounts.json, potential.json, coverage.json, crm-context.json,
learnings.json, partners.json and fy27-territory-plan.json from the run directory.
