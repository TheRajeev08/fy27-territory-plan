"""Companion workbook for the H1 focus deck.

The deck is the argument; this workbook is the evidence behind it. Every number a
reviewer can challenge on a slide is traceable to a row here, including the rate and
basis used for each sized line. It is written as a separate file rather than appended
to the territory-plan workbook so the two skills stay independent.
