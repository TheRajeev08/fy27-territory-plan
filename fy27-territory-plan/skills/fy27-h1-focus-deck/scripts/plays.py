"""Refine play classification once Salesforce industry is known.

    plays.py <runDir>

`workbook.py` assigns plays from the upload alone, and one rung of that ladder needs
a fact the upload does not carry: whether the account operates in a regulated
industry. An account already on GitHub Enterprise with neither Copilot nor GHAS is a
Trust conversation if it is regulated and an Innovate conversation if it is not, and
nothing in SuperDash distinguishes the two. Those accounts are marked
`playPendingIndustry` at build time and settled here.

This step only ever moves an account between Trust and Innovate, with one deliberate
exception: an override carrying `sellerAsserted: true` and a `play` may also give a
play to an account the ladder left "Unclassified". SuperDash has no row for a pure
prospect, so "Unclassified" there means "no data", not "no opportunity". That
exception does not confer a rank - rank.py still requires potential or engagement -
so the focus set cannot grow just because a seller named an account.

Two sources of truth, in order:

  1. `crm-context.json` - Salesforce `Account.Industry`, tested against REGULATED.
  2. `overrides.json` - seller corrections, because the Salesforce picklist is coarse
     and often blank. A medical-device manufacturer is filed under "Manufacturing"
     and a fintech under "Software & Internet"; both are regulated and neither reads
     that way.

Writes the refined play back into fy27-territory-plan.json, which rank.py stage 2
reads, so there is one source of truth for the play rather than two that can drift.
