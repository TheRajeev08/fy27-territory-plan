"""Seller-known facts that Salesforce and SuperDash do not carry.

    overrides.json  (lives in the run directory, alongside crm-context.json)

A territory plan built only from systems of record is wrong in a specific,
predictable way: it knows every deal that has been *entered* and nothing about the
conversation that has not been entered yet. That gap is not noise. The largest
Bucket 1 opportunity in this book existed as a live customer conversation weeks
before it existed as a Salesforce record.

This module is how that knowledge enters the plan without anybody hand-editing an
output file. Two rules make it safe to use:

1. **Overrides supply facts, never rankings.** There is deliberately no "pin this
   account to rank 3". The deck tells leadership its accounts are ranked on
   potential, pipeline, communication and triggers; a forced rank would make that
   sentence a lie. Correct the input and let the ranking move.

2. **An override that matches nothing is an error.** Silent no-ops are how a
   renamed account quietly drops a correction and nobody notices until the number
   is wrong in front of leadership.

Seller-sourced pipeline is tagged `source: "seller"` all the way through to the
deck, because leadership will go looking for it in Salesforce and it will not be
there yet.
