    """Assign the FY27 play from what the account owns today.

    The rule the ladder encodes, and why each rung is where it is:

      * No GitHub Enterprise -> **Scale**. Scale is the migration and displacement
        play; an account that is not on the platform is exactly its target. (The
        previous engine scored *existing* GHE seats as a Scale signal, which pushed
        established customers into a migration motion and left greenfield accounts
        out of it.) `ghe` here must be **true GitHub Enterprise seats** - licence
        seats plus metered users. The SuperDash "GHE/VS" total also counts Visual
        Studio bundle seats, which entitle GHE but do not mean the customer is on it;
        feeding that blended figure in here misreads pure-VS accounts as customers.
      * On GHE with Copilot at or above a quarter of the GHE licence count ->
        **Trust**. Agentic delivery has landed at meaningful scale, so the next
        conversation is governance, security and quality over that generated code.
      * On GHE, below that bar, in a regulated industry -> **Trust**. This is Trust's
        second tier: regulation makes the security and governance conversation the one
        that opens the door even before Copilot has landed. It exists because attach
        alone qualifies too few accounts to carry the play.
      * On GHE, below the bar, unregulated -> **Innovate**. The agentic motion is
        either unstarted or far from saturated, and that headroom is the opportunity.

    The 25% bar is cut at the natural break in the book: accounts with any Copilot
    cluster either at 28% and above or at 9% and below, with nothing in between. An
    account running 10 Copilot seats against 330 GHE licences is a headroom story, not
    a govern-at-scale story, and belongs in Innovate.

    `ghas` is accepted for call-site compatibility but no longer decides membership.
    GHAS used to promote an account to Trust on its own; Copilot is now the sole
    product signal for Trust, so a GHAS customer without Copilot is an Innovate
    account whose security footprint is an asset in the conversation, not a play.

    `regulated` is None when industry is not yet known; the caller refines those
    accounts once Salesforce data is available. The default keeps the account inside
    the play set either way, so ranking is never gated on enrichment that may be
    missing.
