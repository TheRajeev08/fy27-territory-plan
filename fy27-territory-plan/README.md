# FY27 Territory Plan

Turn a SuperDash export into an FY27 territory plan you can hand to a sales leader — every account
bucketed into **Innovate**, **Trust**, or **Scale**, enriched live from **your own** Salesforce and
Gong access, with a meeting-booking shortlist and an Excel workbook.

Ask Copilot:

> Build my FY27 territory plan from ~/Downloads/Super Summary.xlsx

## Why a plugin instead of the web app

The [browser app](https://therajeev08.github.io/fy27-territory-plan-team/) does classification and
export, but a static page can never hold CRM credentials, so engagement is always Unknown there.

This plugin runs inside your authenticated Copilot session, so the Salesforce and Gong calls happen
on **your** credentials, scoped to **your** uploaded accounts. No manifest export, no JSON re-import,
no shared logins.

## Install

Paste this into Terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRajeev08/fy27-territory-plan/main/install.sh | bash
```

It downloads the plugin, installs the one Python dependency, and verifies the result. It is
safe to re-run — an existing copy is updated, and a damaged one is repaired.

Then **quit the Copilot app completely and reopen it** (closing the window is not enough), and ask:

> Build my FY27 territory plan

Optionally install the canvas so results render in-app — ask Copilot:

> Install the extension from https://github.com/TheRajeev08/fy27-territory-plan/tree/main/fy27-territory-plan/extensions/fy27-territory-plan

<summary>Prefer to install by hand?</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRajeev08/fy27-territory-plan.git \
  ~/.copilot/installed-plugins/fy27-territory-plan
python3 -m pip install --user xlsxwriter
```

The clone target is the *bundle* directory: the loader looks for plugins at
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/<bundle>/<plugin>/plugin.json`, which is why this repo nests the
plugin one level down rather than putting `plugin.json` at its root. The repeated folder name
after cloning is expected.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| `github-revenue` plugin, Salesforce-authenticated | Live activity, contacts, pipeline, Gong |
| Python 3.9+ | Classification and scoring |
| `xlsxwriter` | The Excel workbook export |
| `python-pptx` | The H1 focus presentation |

Install the two third-party dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user xlsxwriter python-pptx
```

Without Revenue MCP the plugin still works — plays, Sprint Focus, and the workbook all build
locally. Engagement simply stays **Unknown**, which is reported honestly rather than shown as cold.

## What you get

1. **Normalization stats** — source rows, exact duplicates, parent/child groups collated, and the
   de-duplicated account count, so the numbers are defensible before anyone reads the plan.
2. **Play distribution** — Innovate / Trust / Scale, plus an Unclassified discovery queue for
   accounts with no qualifying product signal. Accounts are never assigned a play without evidence.
3. **Live engagement** — activity volume and direction, verified two-way evidence, named personas,
   open pipeline, and Gong calls for the shortlist, with coverage and an as-of date.
4. **Sprint Focus** — a ranked shortlist of who to book this sprint and why.
5. **Excel workbook** — eight sheets, executive dashboard first.
6. **H1 focus presentation** — ask for it separately, once the plan has run:

   > Build my H1 focus accounts deck

   A 13-slide leadership deck plus a 21-slide evidence pack naming 30–50 focus accounts
   for the half, sized in AIU, Copilot seats and GHE + GHAS, with the execution plan grounded in GitHub's Product Adoption Framework, Microsoft
   and partner leverage, an honest working / not-working read, and the asks of leadership. It ships
   with a companion evidence workbook whose `Sizing Detail` sheet gives one row per sized line with
   its rate and basis, so any figure on a slide can be traced in a single lookup.

## How enrichment stays trustworthy

- **Scoped.** Only Salesforce IDs present in your upload are ever queried; anything else is rejected.
- **Deterministic.** The agent fetches rows; `enrich_activity.py` does every calculation, so the
  same CRM state always yields the same scores.
- **Honest about gaps.** No match means *Unknown*, never cold. A failed source keeps its own status
  and error instead of being rendered as a zero.
- **Isolated.** Each run writes to `~/.copilot/fy27-territory-plan/runs/<timestamp>/`. Nothing is
  written back into this package and nothing is shared between teammates.

Engagement tiers are evidence-first, not score-first:

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Priority | Verified two-way contact **and** a meeting |
| High | Two-way contact **or** a meeting |
| Medium | One-way outreach only, but recent |
| Low | One-way outreach only, and stale |
| Unranked | No matched activity — Unknown, not cold |

## Layout

```
plugin.json
skills/fy27-territory-plan/     orchestrator + scripts (workbook, enrichment, sprint, run setup)
skills/fy27-crm-enrichment/     pinned SOQL and guardrails
skills/fy27-h1-focus-deck/      H1 focus presentation: sizing, ranking, PPTX, evidence workbook
extensions/fy27-territory-plan/ canvas that renders the plan in-app
enrich-test.py                  regression tests for the enrichment transform
```

`workbook.py` is the single source of truth for play classification. The browser app's
`engine-core.js` is parity-tested against it, so the two surfaces cannot drift.

## Caveat

Decision support, not forecast. Potential, engagement, and readiness are hypotheses that need
seller validation — they are not ARR, pipeline, or propensity.
